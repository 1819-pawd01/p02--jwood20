            <!-- History of the Queen Anne Hotel -->
            <h3> History </h3>
            <p> Located in San Francisco, the Queen Anne Hotel is a Victorian-style hotel with a mysterious history. The building was created by senator James G. Fair in 1889 and later became a boarding school for his daughters and other well-to-do girls in 1890. Fair's favorite mistress, Mary Lake, became the Head Mistress of the school. She loved teaching and taking care of the young girls, therefore her heart was broken when the school closed in 1896. </p>
            
            <p> Some people say that the entity of Mary Lake still wanders around the hotel, keeping a close eye on her "guests." She has apparently unpacked and hung up clothes, picked up objects off of the floor, and even tucked covers around guests in the middle of the night. These manifestations are said to be strongest in room 410, which was once her office in the 1890s.</p>
